Project Name: Inventory and Sales Management System for a Small Retail Business
Project Description:

In this project, I designed and managed a Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) database for a small retail business to handle inventory management, sales tracking, and customer data. The goal was to build a system that efficiently managed product stock levels, tracked sales across multiple stores, and provided insights into sales performance and customer behavior. The project helped streamline business operations by automating routine tasks and improving data accessibility for decision-making.

Key Responsibilities:
Database Design & Normalization: Designed a relational database schema to store data about products, sales transactions, customers, and inventory. The schema was normalized to ensure data integrity and minimize redundancy, achieving third normal form (3NF).

Writing SQL Queries for Data Analysis: Developed SQL queries to provide insights into key business metrics, such as product performance, customer purchasing trends, and real-time inventory levels. These queries helped the business identify high-demand products and optimize stock replenishment.

Data Cleaning and Transformation: Cleaned and transformed raw sales and inventory data from various sources to ensure consistency and accuracy. Removed duplicates, standardized formats, and handled missing data to prepare the dataset for reporting and analysis.


Technologies Used:
MSSQL, T-SQL, Data Cleaning
